From Hawaii. Studied in Tokyo. Building in Seattle.

In summer 2025, I was one of the first AI interns at Hawaii's largest bank. I gathered AI use cases across the organization, built a Power BI dashboard, and designed a scoring model to help leadership prioritize what to build next. I'm a founding member and now COO of my university's credit union startup. Currently a rec sports manager helping out with marketing on the side. Passionate about people and getting things done.
